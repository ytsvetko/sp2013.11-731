раджат naga , managing director of the adb 's office in manila , said that the two most emerging big economies should " do everything that they can " to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc with the aid of any of the international monetary fund , or direct bilateral agreements .
" asia may be to some extent protected , but it may not be invulnerable . "
the european monetary union was severely undermined the european debt crisis in last few months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis has spawned fears that he can lead the global economy into recession again , and has led to calls for the leading emerging economies to gather together to help the eurozone to find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's commerce minister , said that " india will do everything that can " to help the eurozone , such as its own economy is now declining exports and a reduction in foreign capital inflows .
" we have great challenge , and we should maintain a high rate of growth . "
others argue , that there is no sense for emerging economies such as india to help wealthy europeans , when they are faced with their own deep economic problems .

mr. knag said , is that the eurozone crisis threatened " significant direct effects throughout asia . "
he said that vulnerable emerging markets need to make " contingency plans " to protect themselves from the downturn and significant оттоков capital out of their economies .
defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and will bring financial chain reaction of the pentagon corridors to the fields of battle in afghanistan , on the line and to civil assembly .
" the consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканцу республиканке and john mccain , arizona , lindsey graham , south carolina .
" so , will make such a strong reduction , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or the building -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote the senators .
" these changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and will do serious damage to readiness . "
" while the military financing in overseas contingency operations do not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by a serious breakdown in the main budgets , " panetta warned .
" the staff personnel will be reduced , that will lead to опозданиям with payments military suppliers , and the legal and political support will be compromised . "
" the consequence of sequestration in the department of defense will be the fastest decline of the united states as the world 's leading military powers . "
" this is not an option , with whom we can live , and this is not an option , that we need to impose ourselves . "
whether a letter to panetta or the latest warning senators will lead to budget compromise or strengthen calls for the release of the pentagon from reductions , will see later .
at a press conference last week , secretary of defense painted a gloomy picture of what can follow the further -- troops with shell , but without the core .
" this is a paper tiger , the army to barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained troops can accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory comments at the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects may face obstacles , including those that passed the tests , and some only in the early stages of planning .
termination of the further development and testing the f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say that it was the vital next step to improve and to counter potential threats , china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly attempted to hide that a retired football coach raping boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged in the financial machinations during the campaign , associated with укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories of fraud on exams in school and college is the norm .
coaches , that should teach the opposite , send a message that lies and cheating are acceptable .
in a single day , studies show that you can lie from 10 to 200 times .
another study revealed that strangers солгали three times for the first ten minutes and get acquainted with each other .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where the need to exclaim " caught ! " , identifying lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the last six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on the psychology and physiology .
should not be out of this draw the conclusion that liars it is difficult to see and it is difficult to expose .
i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about the lies , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn how to identify lies - and which helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interview , negotiation or management .
we know from studies that extroverts lie more often than introverts , and that the men lie about yourself , whereas the women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lie , that they say , often наглая ) .
watch позой , a laugh , voice characteristics of your object .
rats can fix the upper part of his body , when they try to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , to change its position in a certain way or demonstrate the " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in a speech : " i did not have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky ... " or repeat a complex question entirely .
someone might use the " qualification language " when responding to a complex question : " well ... to tell the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know . "
there is no magic tools to identify the lies , but to master the skill detection of deception can be .

olga sanchez кордеро draft statement prepared by the minister , offered to declare the decree unconstitutional , because the regulation of the radio and television programs - right , enshrined in law for the federal telecommunications commission ( cofetel ) , in violation of principles hierarchical subordination and legislative reserve .
on this argument and the senate , and spent two constitutional debate , chamber of deputies to refute the decree and to support the complaint , the minister of sanchez кордеро suspended application of the decree and all actions , the it about the transition to digital broadcasting .

the administration under the leadership of former european commissioner monti should approve the package of austerity , required european leaders to restore confidence in italy .
emma марчегалия , leader of the italian employers ' federation , told reporters after meeting with monti : " we were told that we will actively support this government . "
monti 's chances of success were largely based on the ldp 's support of the party of silvio berlusconi , who was forced to resign on saturday because of the economic crisis .
support for the ldp , the biggest party in italy , has a meaning , because until now , many of its members opposed the government majority , which consists of monti 's technocrats , which forms .
monti 's new government must have a strong parliamentary support for reform , which is likely to continue to be unpopular austerity reforms .
italian association of foreign banks intensified pressure , warning that the failure of the monti could be a disaster .

i think we all feel some оторванность from the word гранж .
first , your music were more gloomy , and now it has become more positive .
it 's interesting , because i think , there are a few songs on this album , which may seem easier , but there are songs such as the end , or just breathe , which are considered to be very grim , though they may sound a bit positively .
i think that when you grow , and in your life has been some sort of injury and you have lost family member or friend , these events are starting to affect your creativity and your music , and those two songs , of course , reflect this for me .

the first fear is the restriction of the border , where you can build .
" we must think about the new city planning tools , because the current [ with regard to the capital plan ( gsp ) ] can lead to real trouble . "
модоло recalls that already has a work made outside the кальсеролы , which " should not miss ailianduo " , although he 's grateful for the possibility that city hall offers his profession , to join in this project " since the beginning . "
байона hints that answer the question , which sets the name of this part of the complex , as in the rules of the contest lacks a common type of кольсеролы : " it was announced 16 intersecting contests , " he says , " within the meaning of the sea - mountain , but there are no buckling reading , to see and understand the region as a whole . "
on the other hand , the project for some gate may overlap on the program and the definition of the project architect for neighboring gate .

in his lecture in technological view of the pits , as part of the international year of chemistry , reported that laboratory , for which he is responsible , is developing polymer - modified bitumen for mixed with characteristics of the close to the bitumen production , but with the best opposition , both in high and low temperatures .
he explained that the bitumen , the most difficult part of the oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами , and other low - molecular weight - мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his typical вязкоупругое demeanor .
this means that the resistance street asphalt is not constant , and the change during the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperatures , " said an expert in chemical engineering .
among the most is the upper layers of bitumen , made up of small stones , опущенных in bitumen and then спрессованных .
a movement of the vehicles and latch effort , it helps to be distributed on the road to cover very well .
on асфальтовом cover , he added , put the latest layer , called a layer of wear and tear , which is made out of the small stone , in fact , the sand also immersed in the asphalt .
as part of the pavement , which will receive and distribute these efforts , the layer wear also requires the proper thickness , and it is necessary to take into account the material , from which he is .

despite the appointment of new heads of state in greece and italy and improved growth in france and germany , the stakes in unstable countries continue to grow
in the paris cac 40 lost 1.4 % in the 10 a.m. and ended up trading at the level of 3.064 points .
in connection with the new difficulties with payment of loans to eurozone countries , located in a difficult position , stock markets around the world continue to lose part of its recent gains .
tokyo stock exchange closed with the fall of 0.7 per cent under the weight of the new doubts about market participants for europe 's ability to contain the debt crisis .
this is a return of worries about the future of the eurozone hits the single currency , which on tuesday , has continued to fall .

insee , despite this , in the side of reducing the numbers of the second quarter , with the fall of the 0.1 % of the gross domestic product ( gdp ) instead of stagnation .
, germany , in turn , the recorded growth of 0.5 % over the same period .
if there is a theme , a decision on which cannot be taken after a short discussion or under the influence of emotions , so it is energy policy .
this is a healthy trend that election meetings have become an occasion for reflection on share and place their nuclear energy .
france needs to build their opinion on objective facts and rational data .
during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources , to continue electricity production all the time , not forgetting about the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to fight climate imbalance - theme , which disappeared from the environmental debate .
that is why germany is one in its decision to abandon nuclear energy .
on the other hand , britain , finland , poland , czech republic , the netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india and brazil is only a few of those who strongly continues his projects .
although the german model , based on renewable energy , sometimes cited as an example , the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which it receives 30 % of its electricity , and she was also the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого wind ; because of what carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the keystone of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french companies are benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
the price that the majority of the french refuse to pay more because they do not oppose this type of energy in the principle .
heavily export - oriented , she attracts a contemporaries specialized on international trade in small and medium - sized enterprises and creates a lot of jobs , which may not be moved to another industry .
what engineer electrician will be the order epr , calculated to work sixty years , if the planned closure of its manufacturer ? "
development of areva solutions with low - carbon , nuclear and renewable , shows взаимодополнимости sources of energy .
in france we have the security body , which carries out , too , and a transparent control existing energy centres , such as фламанвиль .
for 50 years , the nuclear industry has endured three serious incident .
device in the chernobyl reactor and unforgivable human error that has led to the tragedy .
the nuclear industry will learn from this accident , as learned from the previous two .
as he considered all the specialists in the field of energy , willing to build a reactor , stop its construction in фламанвиле will be a great gift rivals areva and edf , menacing them ​​путь toward the conquest of leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy .
then was administrative harassment of foreign students , which was in the news release , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from may 23 ) , said that france " does not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see in immigration burden for the french economy and for french society .
in its program of francois hollande was confined to platitudes , saying that " work together will solve our problem of immigration . "
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people will determine our future , may 2011 , publisher at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears for the influence of immigrants are based on the view that they are able to replace local workers , especially low - skilled , provoking lower salaries .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor force , and the most qualified , in dynamic sectors , where training is not connected to the offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be difficult to work in a country where there is a shortage анестезиологов , complementarity , between local and immigrants that the arrival of the immigrants , leads to positively affect the salaries of local workers .
and this is without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all immigrants are based ) .
according to the labor organization , for example , in germany , an immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) in an average of 150 euros .
these teeth , which used to scare immigrants , was given exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is a valuable acquisition ; but at the same time and fragile .
some thought that democracy had finally triumphed over their enemies , it is enough to vote and to make it so direct , as far as possible .
universal vote , though , and is a sine qua non condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a " tool of suppression " , as republican once - philosopher etienne вашро said .
the european crisis that we are experiencing , " this is the economic crisis , but the first of all it is a political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we do n't win anything , demanding a series of national referendums , organized as needed and in хаотическом right . "
there is no , we are dreaming not of the blade the guillotine , but on the implementation of the " joint , the clear and constant - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level .
the whole of europe as a whole is subject to dictates markets and rating agencies , suffer from their weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty to europe , but the whole of europe completely gradually loses its sovereignty , and together with each of its nations .
because the only joint work of europeans will be able to reduce the severity of the debt each , free from markets and prepare for the future , investing in it .
after a long discussion of this proposal socialists and jacques delors all now requiring the european economic government .
but to represent it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in the life граздан , is a another madness and a new impasse .
to install the republic in france , was to " create " the republican .
this can only be done by creating a more democratic europe at the political level , this popular european sovereignty .
in fact , 2011 will be completed 11 % rise in the world sales of microprocessors ( bank cards , mobile phones with sim cards ) , above , according to the eurosmart , 6 thousand million units .
this year , in the world would be sold 460 million бесконтактных smart cards against 320 million a year earlier !
europe , for a long time lagged from the asia - pacific region , is now moving forward in the field of бесконтактных payments .
france starts with the more modest positions : in circulation are 400.000 бесконтактных cards , visa .
in this year , carrefour has 2.5 million a бесконтактных pass mastercard .
" two large organizations in france promised in the future has systematically to distribute among their clients , bank cards , adapted for non - use , " said gerard небуи , director - general of the visa europe , france .
but this is only the first stage of development in the future of the means of payment , i.e. mobile phone .
" we expect at the global sales from 80 to 120 million units in 2012 , " explains mark бертен , head of the eurosmart .
yesterday , crédit agricole announced the experiment from december to june next year in the massacre .
confirmed for a long time предполагавшиеся connection between the terrorist group al qaeda in islamic maghreb ( aqmi ) and the nigerian sect boko haram .
" the way in which use these two organizations , and reports of the secret services show that they are actively cooperating , " he explained , without going into detail .
among the debris , left after the operation , french and нигерские , investigators found a few telephone sim card belonging to the terrorists .
analysis of the incidents calls pointed out several interlocutors , 58/89 in mali , niger and nigeria .
" this is a step forward , but there is no doubt , we need to wait for more reliable evidence , before talk about the operational cooperation between aqmi and boko haram . "
" for many years , it is known that sect receives financial and идейную support from the outside and that it is becoming more and more and more active , " says кунле амуво , nigerian researcher .
the international community led by washington now puts pressure on абуджу , to pay attention to the problem , which creates boko haram .
it is mainly on the churches , bars and authorities .
in the past christmas , she took on responsibility for the diluted share , as a result of which 80 people were killed in джосе , and then another for one in abuja .
in august , the local office of the united nations will be their first international goal .
today , when the aqmi strengthened in mali and niger , and somalis from al-shabaab operate in kenya , boko haram poses a challenge to the continent .
whether weakened by crisis america can lead a complex world with the help of the simple , or rather simplistic ideas ?
already a few days of mitt romney , the distance kane , rick perry and other multiply loud , but deprived of the details of the statements on foreign policy , which are traditionally strong republican party .
mitt romney , who has the best chances of the nomination from the " good old party , has threatened to sue the chinese complaint to the wto and accuse them of " manipulation of its currency is a sensitive subject for america , irritated migration for their industries in asia .
john huntsman , former obama ambassador to china and the only one candidate , the complex foreign policy , was unable to overcome position that indulging your emotions .
but huntsman , who rests at the bottom of the rankings , remained неуслышанным .
romney also promised military strikes against iran if sanctions will not be able to stop its nuclear program .
" if obama will be re - elected , they will have a bomb . "
entrepreneur distance kane , second in the ranking of candidates demonstrated the daunting ignorance of the cases .
texas governor rick perry , who supports israel and seeks to military strikes on iran , says that he was ready to use of the us army against drug cartels in mexico .
it is very far from the 2008 republican presidential candidate john mccain , the all - тяжеловеса foreign policy .
they resemble that obama himself was lover and that he had to reduce tone with regard to the fight against terror .
after iraq , it does not believe in military intervention , which confused in the sand .
nord stream , the new gates for the entry of russian gas to europe .
he is on the supply of gas equivalent of 30 million households .
more than 500 guests , including four heads of state and governments took part in the last tuesday on the banks of the baltic sea , between the performance of the orchestra and exquisite snacks , in the opening of the nord stream , a new pipeline , which directly connects russia and germany under water .
under the new pipeline 27.5 million of additional cubic meters of gas will come every year in western europe on the first 1 224 km long pipeline connecting the leningrad region with the land of mecklenburg - western pomerania .
and an opportunity to build a third of the pipeline at the same direction has already been discussed .
the two countries will lose some of their power : they will be more difficult to influence russia , threatening to shut down access to western european markets .
but at the cost of europe 's energy , because the project has created a gap between eastern and western europe .
" this pipeline is part of cooperation with russia , it 's a new artery , which organically connects us , " said francois fillon , opening the gas pipeline , demonstrating the extent to which large gas contracts are important and politically , and economically .
" a hundred , it was necessary to remove or destroy as a precaution , " said jens mueller , a spokeswoman for the company north flow .

" in the event of an accident , we close the flow of gas less , than a minute , " said jens muller .
but this seems unlikely designers who design seams , designed to протечку just once in 100 000 years .
сигароообразный device is inside the a 1 - metre diameter pipeline and pushed forward the flow of gas .
gas pipeline was designed to work for 50 years without the need for any repairs .
these five companies created a joint venture , called the north stream , which were commissioned to build and operate the pipeline .
then gazprom gave the company in rent on twenty years with the possibility of extending all the volume of gas transportation .
gas pipeline construction financing was provided on the 30 % of shareholders and 70 % of the bank credits .
gas pipeline out of the baltic sea in lubmin on a sandy beach , mulberry coniferous trees .
sensors measure the pressure , temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before they siphoned it in the german gas pipelines .
at full capacity it will be 3 million in an hour , and in the year 2012 6 million .
